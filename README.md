# Batch Gradient Descent, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Maximum Likelihood Estimation using Python

Regression is an interesting technique of estimating the values among variables. In this experiment, I implement and test three algorithms of regression (batch gradient descent, stochastic gradient descent, and maximum likelihood estimation) using the gaussian function as a basis function to fit random noisy data I generate that represent the cosine function (plus noise).
